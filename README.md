# Eventually

Eventually is a one page, responsive pre-launching site template. It is a port of [HTML5 UP's Eventually Template](https://html5up.net/eventually). I have tried to port it to hugo. Please help me with your valuable feedbacks.


## Live Demo

Check the theme in action [Here](#)


## Features

I have added the following params as variable:

1. pagetitle - A page title for the landing page to put at the top
2. description1 - Small description
3. description2 - Small description
4. twitter - Social Media Link
5. instagram - Social Media Link
6. github - Social Media Link
7. email - Social Media Link

## Installation

Run the following commands inside the folder of your Hugo site:

	$ cd themes
	$ git clone https://github.com/sagarmusabbir/Eventually.git


## Configure

Copy the config.toml file from the exampleSite folder into your root folder of your Hugo site. Change the fields as needed. Be sure to change the baseurl. Add or delete social media as needed. You may need to look up the [font-awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icon names. In the configuration file add your personal information. 

After installation, you simply have to set up the config.toml file to get started.
```toml
[params]
pagetitle = 'PRELAUNCH'
description1 = 'A simple hugo theme for telling the world when you will launch your next big thing.'
description2 = 'This is an HTML5UP.NET template ported by MUSABBIRSAGAR.COM'
twitter = 'https://twitter.com/#'
instagram = 'https://instagram.com/#'
github = 'https://twitter.com/'
email = 'https://twitter.com/'
```

## Change the Sliders

Should you choose to change the background slides, create a `/static/css/images` folder and add pictures named `bg01.jpg`, `bg02.jpg`, `bg03.jpg`.
